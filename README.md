# Fourier Method for Image Registration

This project implements various Fourier transform-based methods for image registration and analysis. It includes implementations for:

- Translation invariance analysis
- Rotation effects on Fourier spectra
- Scale effects on Fourier spectra
- 2D image registration using Fourier transforms

## Project Structure

- `spectre_amplitude_tran.py`: Implementation for translation invariance analysis
- `spectre_amplitude_rota.py`: Implementation for rotation effects analysis
- `spectre_amplitude_scale.py`: Implementation for scale effects analysis
- `script.py`: Main script for image registration
- `image_fourier_transfom_example.py`: Example implementation of Fourier transform

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Usage

Each script can be run independently to demonstrate different aspects of Fourier transform-based image registration. The main registration functionality is implemented in `script.py`.

## Results

The project includes various visualization outputs showing the effects of different transformations on image spectra.
